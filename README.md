# Preprocessing-forecast-data-from-DMI

A Jupyter Notebook that accesses, preprocesses and interactively plots wave forecast data from DMI and saves it as a .netcdf file. 

It can be opened in a GIS program for further analysis or visualisations, for instance in QGIS using temporal controller or Crayfish plugin for animation. Alternatively, the data can be browsed and downloaded with the help of QGIS STAC Browser plugin
